## About Me
Hi there I'm Zeus! 
I have a strong background in offensive security, with certifications like OSCP and experience working with various SMEs in network security. My passion for ethical hacking and cybersecurity drives me to constantly learn and improve. If you're on a similar path, I hope my work can inspire and assist you!

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeus-chan) if you want to reach out or collaborate.

### Why I'm Sharing This
During my OSCP journey, I relied heavily on the contributions of others, from blog posts to cheat sheets and scripts. Now, itâ€™s my turn to give back. By sharing my notes and methodologies, I hope to make it easier for others to tackle the exam. Whether you're a beginner just starting your OSCP journey or an experienced professional looking to refresh your skills, I hope you find these resources useful.

Feel free to explore the resources on this site:

- **Cheat Sheets**: Quick copy paste commands to save time during the exam.
- **Methodologies**: Step-by-step processes that I used for enumeration, gaining foothold, privilege escalation, pivoting and many more.
- **Scripts**: Custom-made tools and scripts that I used throughout the OSCP labs and exam.

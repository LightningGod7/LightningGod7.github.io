# Welcome to My OSCP Journey

Hello! I'm **[Your Name]**, an OSCP-certified cybersecurity professional. After many hours of hard work and dedication, I successfully passed the OSCP exam, and now, I want to give back to the cybersecurity community by sharing the materials, scripts, and cheat sheets that helped me along the way.

### Why I'm Sharing This
During my OSCP journey, I relied heavily on the contributions of others, from blog posts to cheat sheets and scripts. Now, itâ€™s my turn to give back. By sharing my notes and methodologies, I hope to make it easier for others to tackle the exam. Whether you're a beginner just starting your OSCP journey or an experienced professional looking to refresh your skills, I hope you find these resources useful.

Feel free to explore the resources on this site:

- **Cheat Sheets**: Handy scripts and commands to save time during the exam.
- **Methodologies**: Step-by-step processes that I used for enumeration, privilege escalation, and exploitation.
- **Scripts**: Custom-made tools and scripts that I used throughout the OSCP labs and exam.
